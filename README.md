Question 1:

Write a program that takes n inputs.

Input 1 is a integer

Input 2 up to input n takes a sequence of integers that are used to create a list

Your program is supposed to count the number of times the first input (integer) appears in the

list of integers created from input 2 to input n.

Make sure your program takes in only integers for input 1 to input n

For any attempt to input a string, your program should instruct the programmer to input an

integer instead and give the inputer the opportunity to re-enter a number instead.

The programmer continues to enter integers until the a keyword is inputed. Example “done”,

“stop” etc.

Finally, the output is a count of times input 1 appears in the list created out of input 2 to n.

Eg.

Enter number to check:

3

Enter number for list: 4

Enter number for list: 5

Enter number for list: 6

Enter number for list: 2

Enter number for list: 6

Enter number for list: 2

Enter number for list: 3

Enter number for list: 3

Enter number for list: done

count 2

 

 

Question 2:

Write a program that takes two inputs

Input 1 is any sequence of values

Input 2 is also a sequence of values

The program removes all values in the sequence from input 1 that are also present in the

sequence of values from input 2

Finally it returns the values from input 1 as a list devoid of any elements present in input 2.

Eg.

Enter first list: a b c d

Enter second list: a c

result: [‘b', 'd']

 

Question 3:

Write a program that takes inputs 1 to n.

Input 1 is an integer

Input 2 is an integer

Inputs 3 to n are elements of a list.

All inputs should be integers.

Inputs 1 and 2 will be used as lower and upper bounds for slicing the list into a subset

After slicing, the program finds the minimum, maximum, length, and sum of the list integers.

Your program should be written such that it handles errors cleanly communicating to the

programer to input the correct values.

Errors could arise from inputing strings or specify out of range indexes

Eg.

Enter minimum index: 1

Enter maximum index: 4

Enter numbers for list: 3

Enter numbers for list: 3

Enter numbers for list: 4

Enter numbers for list: 5

Enter numbers for list: 6

Enter numbers for list: 1

Enter numbers for list: 2

Enter numbers for list: done

length of list 4

minimum value of list 3

maximum value of list 6

sum of values in list 18

 

 

Question 4:

Write a c# program that takes a sequence of inputs from users and prints out the following

outputs:

Number of positive even numbers

Number of negative even numbers

Number of positive odd numbers

Number of negative odd numbers

Number of zeros

The program should be able to ensure that the users inputs are numbers

You are required to test your program to ensure that no inputs break the program

Eg.

Enter sequence of numbers: 2 3 4 5 3 2 -2 -4 -5 0 0 done

number of positive odd numbers 3

number of negative odd numbers 1

number of positive even numbers 3

number of negative
